Collaboration on Cloud Architecture Strategy  

Dear IT Team,  

I’m excited to collaborate with you as we design and implement our Azure cloud strategy. As the   Azure Solutions Architect  , my role is to ensure our cloud infrastructure is secure, scalable, and aligned with business goals.  

A key aspect of this collaboration is decision-making around cloud services. Based on workload requirements, security considerations, and cost optimization, I will be responsible for selecting the appropriate Azure services. For example, prioritizing   PaaS solutions over IaaS   where feasible to enhance automation and efficiency.  

I value your technical expertise and input, particularly in areas like integration, deployment, and monitoring  . By working together, we’ll ensure a streamlined cloud environment that supports innovation while maintaining operational excellence.  

I look forward to engaging in technical discussions and aligning our strategies for a successful implementation. Please feel free to share any insights or concerns.  

Best regards,  
Sunandha  
Azure Solutions Architect
